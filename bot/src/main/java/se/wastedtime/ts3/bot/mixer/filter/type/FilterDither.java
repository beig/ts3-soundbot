/**
 * Applies a digital filter to the output signal to reduce PCM rounding errors.
 * By understanding the output bit depth (16 bit, normally), we can apply a certain amount
 * of randomness to the output to encourage the bits to move enough to represent the true value
 * of the waveforms.
 * <p>
 * from Wikipedia:
 * This leads to the dither solution. Rather than predictably rounding up or down in a repeating pattern,
 * it is possible to round up or down in a random pattern. Dithering is a way to randomly toggle the results
 * between 4 and 5 so that 80% of the time it ended up on 5 then it would average 4.8 over the long run but
 * would have random, non-repeating error in the result.
